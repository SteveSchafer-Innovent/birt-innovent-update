Innovent has developed and is developing Open Source tools that can be used to develop, deploy and integrate BIRT reports.  This project site represents the common hub for all of Innovent Google Code sites.  At this site, we host the Eclipse Update site that allows you to add our components to your Eclipse installation.  If you just want to use our components, use our [update site](http://innovent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/update).

If you are using Eclipse 2.5.1 / 2.5.2 / 2.6.0 the URL to paste into your Eclipse update manager is
```
 http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/birt-innovent-update/2.5.2
```

If you are using 2.3.2 version of BIRT then you should use
```
 http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/birt-innovent-update/2.3.2
```


If you would like to see the source or contribute to any of the projects you should visit the individual project sites.
